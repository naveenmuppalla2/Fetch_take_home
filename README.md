● How will you read messages from the queue?
I'm using the boto3 library to connect to the sqs queue using the given endpoint url, then processing the messages in the queue until the queue is empty. 

● What type of data structures should be used?
I'm using the dictionary to store the loaded json object and aftr checking the attributed, I'm storing the all the fields into database

● How will you mask the PII data so that duplicate values can be identified?
 The idea is to replace the sensitive information with a masked value consistently so that duplicates remain identifiable, 
 but the actual sensitive data is not exposed .

● What will be your strategy for connecting and writing to Postgres?
 By importing psycopg2  to connect to the databse, and have a cursor from the connections then write each valid record to the databse ans commit the cursor.
 
● Where and how will your application run?
Currently I'm running the application on local machine by connecting to the both postgrs and local stack queue images running in the docker, we can alos launch 
the same application in the same comntainer after installing all the required libraries in the container.

**Assignment** 
● How would you deploy this application in production?
● What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?
● How can this application scale with a growing dataset.
● How can PII be recovered later on?
● What are the assumptions you made

Deploying the Application in Production:
1.Container Orchestration: Use container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage and deploy containers in a production environment.
2.Logging and Monitoring:Implement robust logging and monitoring using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Prometheus and Grafana to track application performance, errors, and resource usage.
3.Secrets Management:Store sensitive information, such as database credentials and API keys, securely using a secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
4.Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment process. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions can be used for this purpose.
5.Environment Configuration:Implement different environment configurations (development, testing, production) with proper handling of configuration parameters.
6.Security Measures:Follow security best practices, such as regularly updating dependencies, securing communication between services, and conducting security audits.

Components for Production-Readiness:
1.Load Balancing:Introduce a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of your application, ensuring high availability and scalability.
2.Database Scaling:Depending on the dataset size and performance requirements, consider database scaling options such as vertical scaling (upgrading server resources) or horizontal scaling (adding more database nodes).
3.Data Partitioning/Sharding:Implement data partitioning or sharding strategies in the database to distribute the load evenly and improve query performance.
4.Backup and Recovery:Set up regular backups of the PostgreSQL database to prevent data loss. Implement a recovery plan in case of system failures.
5.Automated Scaling:Utilize auto-scaling features offered by cloud providers to automatically adjust the number of application instances based on traffic and resource demands.

Scaling with a Growing Dataset:
1.Distributed Processing:Consider distributed processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark) for handling large datasets efficiently.
2.Optimized Database Indexing:Optimize database indexing strategies to improve query performance as the dataset grows.
3.Caching Mechanisms:Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database.
4.Batch Processing:Implement batch processing for handling data in chunks rather than processing the entire dataset at once.

Recovering PII Data:
1.Key Management:Implement a robust key management system if encryption was used for PII masking. Ensure that keys are securely stored and can be recovered by authorized personnel.
2.Audit Logging:Log any access or changes to PII recovery mechanisms to ensure accountability and compliance with data protection regulations.
3.Access Controls:Enforce strict access controls to limit who can recover PII data. This includes role-based access control (RBAC) and regular access reviews.

Assumptions:
1.Data Quality:The assumed data quality is good, and the structure of incoming JSON data is consistent.
2.Security Measures:The application assumes the presence of network security measures, firewalls, and other infrastructure-level security controls.
3.AWS Localstack:The assumption is that the localstack environment accurately simulates the AWS SQS behavior.
4.Single Database Instance:The initial design assumes a single PostgreSQL instance. For production, you might need to consider database replication, clustering, or other high-availability solutions.
5.Hashing for PII Masking:The assumption is that hashing is an acceptable method for PII masking. Depending on regulations and requirements, encryption might be necessary.
6.No Error Handling:The provided code lacks extensive error handling for production scenarios. In a production system, you would implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.
7.Scaling Strategies:The suggested scaling strategies are general recommendations. The most suitable strategy depends on the specific characteristics and requirements of the application and dataset.
